### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am John Jefferies, a young software engineer trying to make my way into the industry.

I graduated from Virginia Tech with my Bachelors in Computer Science.

I am currently employed as a Senior Associate Engineer at Infosys where I am working on multiple projects as a Quality Assurance Software Tester.

I am trying to break into a new role as a developer, but still trying to figure out which space is right for me.

I am currently learning JavaScript to go along with web development.
